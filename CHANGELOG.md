# Changelog

### 1.5.0

- Make a number of fields `final` that should not be changed.
- Add types to a few members.
- Remove nullability from a field fields.
- Require Dart 3.0

### 1.4.1

- Fix null assertion when accessing valueBytes before encodedBytes.

### 1.4.0

* Reverted parsing of APPLICATION tags to the older behaviour. If the constructed bit  is
 set, the tag is parsed as an ASN1Sequence. The recent updates broke LDAP ASN1 parsing.

### 1.3.0

* Adds classes to handle non primitive classes: ASN1Application,ASN1ContextSpecific, ASN1Private. 
* This is a potential change in behavior for consumers that expect some of these classes
 to be parsed as primitive or sequence types. See [README.md]
* The `encodeApplicationTagsAsObject` option on ASN1Parser has been dropped as it
 is now the default. Consumers should reparse bytes they know to be a sequence, etc.

### 1.2.2

- Fix #62. Allow context specific tags to be cast to an asn1 sequence.

### 1.2.1

- Fix #57

### 1.2.0 

- Fix #61. Adds a flag to the parser `encodeApplicationTagsAsObject` that will 
 force APPLICATION objects to be encoded as ASN1Objects, skipping any attempt to create sequences.

### 1.1.1

- fix: Use the correct value for `unusedBits` in `ASN1BitString.fromBytes `

### 1.1.0

- Add optional flag whether to relax parsing, off by default, for backwards-compatibility

### 1.0.3

- Add ASN1BMPString support

### 1.0.2

- Better toString() for ASN1ObjectIdentifier
